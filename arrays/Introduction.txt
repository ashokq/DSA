Arrays in Java: A Detailed Explanation
An array in Java is a data structure that allows you to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable. Arrays are useful for organizing and managing collections of data efficiently. Here's an in-depth look:

1. Definition
An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. The length of an array is established when the array is created and cannot be changed afterward.


2. Features of Arrays
Fixed Size: The size of the array is specified when it is created and cannot be modified later.

Indexed Access: Each element in an array is accessed using an index, starting from 0.

Homogeneous Elements: All elements in an array must be of the same data type.

Efficient Access: Arrays provide efficient access to elements using their indices.


3. Declaration and Initialization
There are two steps to creating an array in Java:

Declare the array.

Allocate memory and optionally initialize it.

Syntax:
dataType[] arrayName;   // Preferred
// OR
dataType arrayName[];

Syntax: Instantiation:
arrayName = new dataType[size];



4. Accessing Array Elements
Array elements are accessed using their index:
System.out.println(numbers[0]); // Outputs: 10
